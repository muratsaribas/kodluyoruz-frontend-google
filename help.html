    <p>To enter a query into Google, 
        <b>
            <font color="#38A808">
                just type in a few descriptive keywords and hit "search."

        </b>
        That's it. If you need them, however, we also provide a few 
        advanced search operators.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>

                </b>
                
                Google automatically prefers pages where the query terms are found
                in close proximity. However, sometimes the only relevant pages are
                those where some or all of the query words occur as a phrase. You can 
                <b>
                    <font color="#38A808">
                        enclose words in double-quotes 
                    </font>
                </b>
                ("like this") to force the words to appear together in all returned
                documents.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>
                    <font color="red">NEW!</font>
                    <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica" >The - operator. </font>
                </b>
                Sometimes it is helpful to choose words to exclude from a search. That is,
                you want all relevant pages except those containing a certain word. We support
                this "not" functionality with the "-" operator. Simply 
                <b>
                    <font color="#38A808">
                        prefix your query word with a -
                    </font>
                </b>
                (-like -this) to make Google ignore all pages containing that word.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">
                    Automatic AND.
                </font>
            </b>
            Google only supports "and" queries. That is, it only returns pages that
            include all the query terms. The + operator, which enforces "and" behavior
            on some search engines, is unnecessary on Google (though it can be used
            to include stopwords; see below).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">
            Do more than query
        </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The results of a Google search do a lot to help point you toward the right
        result: the 
        <a href="legend.html">numbers in the results</a>
        help you figure out result quality, and the query word-sensitive content
        helps you figure out what the pages are about.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results can also be used for further exploration of the web. Click on
        the bar graph at the beginning of the result, and see 
        <b>
            <font color="#38A808">
                what pages link to this page.
            </font>
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Click on the "cached" link, and see what the
        <b>
            <font color="#38A808">
                page looked like when we indexed it.
            </font>
        </b>
        Has the page changed so much it doesn't hold the information you need 
        anymore? Perhaps the version in the cache will be more helpful.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">
            Feeling luckly?
        </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The "I feel luckly" button automatically takes you to the first web page
        returned for your query. When it works -- and it often works -- it means 
        less time searching for web pages and more time looking at them.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">
            Special Searches

    <p>
        Want to limit your search to web pages regarding 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202230410/http:/www.google.com/linux">Linux</a>?

        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990224014327/http://www.google.com/stanford">Standord</a>?
        Then site search is for you. It Searches only a subset of the full web, providing
        pages that are even more likely to be relevant to your needs.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">
            Limitations on queries
        </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Google does not support all of the operations found in all search engines.
        Many of these we plan on supporting in a future release.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>
                    <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">
                        No "or" operator.
                    </font>
                </b>
                Most search engines will return pages that contain only some of the query terms,
                sometimes in preference to pages that contain all the terms! Google only returns pages
                that contain all the terms. There is no way to turn off this behavior. There is also
                no way to tell Google to accept pages containing eihter word A or word B. You must
                submit the query twice, once with word A and once with word B.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>
                    <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">
                        Google doesn't "stem."
                    </font>
                </b>
                Some search engines automatically expand your search, so when you type in "wood"
                it searches for "woods" as well, and maybe even "woody" or "wooden." There's some
                argument about whether this is good or bad, but Google does not support it. If in
                doubt, try both forms: "airline" <i>and</i> "airlines," for instance.
            </p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">
            Stopwords
        </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Google removes common words such as "the" and "of" from the query before it starts
        to search. Use <tt>"+the"</tt> or <tt>"+of"</tt> to prevent the common word from being removed.
        This is sometimes helpful when the word is important for completing a phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since some other search engines (but not Google) use "and" and "or" as search
        operators, Google ignores them. If you want to use "and" or "or" as actual query words, 
        you can use <tt>"+and"</tt> or <tt>"+or"</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you need to use "+" even within quotation marks. A query like
        <tt>"lord of the flies"</tt> will normally search for documents with "lord" and "flies"
        and any two words in between them. You can use <tt>"lord +of +the flies"</tt> to force
        those two words to be "of" and "the".
